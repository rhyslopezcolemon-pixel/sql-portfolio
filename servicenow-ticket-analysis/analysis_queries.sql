# Analysis Insights

This document summarizes key findings from exploratory analysis of a synthetic
ServiceNow-style incident dataset representing virtual support activity in 2023.
The goal of this analysis is to establish operational baselines and evaluate
overall resolution effectiveness before pursuing deeper segmentation or trend analysis.


# Analysis Insights

## Daily Incident Volume Baseline

This analysis establishes a baseline for daily virtual support ticket volume across business days in 2023. 
Results show that daily incident counts typically center around approximately 15 tickets per day, with 
natural variation above and below that level.

Establishing this baseline is critical for operational analysis, as it allows future spikes or drops in 
volume to be evaluated against normal workload expectations rather than in isolation.


## Overall Incident Resolution Rate

This analysis measures overall resolution effectiveness across all incidents in 2023.
Approximately 80–85% of tickets were resolved, while the remaining portion remained unresolved
at the time of analysis.

This high-level KPI provides essential context for evaluating operational performance and
establishes a benchmark for deeper analysis by time period, asset association, or user behavior.
