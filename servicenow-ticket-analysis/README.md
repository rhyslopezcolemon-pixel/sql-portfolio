# ServiceNow Ticket Analysis (2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a synthetic ServiceNow-style incident dataset representing virtual support activity during calendar year 2023. The goal is to demonstrate practical SQL skills applied to real-world IT service management and operational reporting scenarios.

The dataset reflects a standard Monday–Friday support schedule and includes realistic incident volume, resolution patterns, user activity, and asset associations.

## Business Context
Incomplete contact information, inconsistent resolution rates, and uneven ticket volume can create operational bottlenecks in virtual support environments. This analysis focuses on understanding incident trends, resolution effectiveness, and patterns that could inform workflow improvements.

## Data Description
The project uses three related tables:
- **Incidents**: Individual support tickets with contact date, resolution status, user identifier, and optional asset association
- **Users**: Synthetic user identifiers representing repeat requesters
- **Assets**: Synthetic asset identifiers representing managed devices or systems

All data is fictional and created solely for portfolio demonstration purposes.

## Key Questions Explored
- How many incidents are logged per day?
- What percentage of incidents are resolved versus unresolved?
- How do resolution rates change over time?
- Are asset-associated incidents resolved more frequently?
- Which users generate the most incidents?

## Tools Used
- SQL (analysis and aggregation)
- Excel (data generation and validation)
- GitHub (version control and portfolio presentation)
